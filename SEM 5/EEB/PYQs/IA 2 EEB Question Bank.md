**Q) Explain with example the following statement, "E-Commerce can result in globalization of business activity".  _(10M)_**

E-Commerce demolishes geographical barriers, allowing even the smallest business to become a global enterprise. 

A traditional "brick-and-mortar" store is limited to customers who can physically visit its location. In contrast, an e-commerce website is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world.

**Example:** 
A small artisan jewelry maker in Jaipur, India, can set up an online store on Etsy or Shopify. Through digital marketing and global shipping partners, they can sell their unique products to customers in the United States, Europe, and Australia. 

Without e-commerce, reaching this global audience would be prohibitively expensive and logistically complex. 

Thus, e-commerce directly enables the globalization of their business activity, transforming a local operation into an international brand.

---

- **Advertising Model:** Provides content and services for free, supported by advertising revenue (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Affiliate Model:** A site earns commissions by referring customers to another company's site (e.g., affiliate bloggers).

**Q) Comment on the statement: "Advancement in Technology has included the types of business activities." _(10M)_**

This statement is profoundly accurate. Technological advancement has not merely improved existing business activities; it has fundamentally **created and included entirely new categories** of them, reshaping the economic landscape.

Traditionally, business was largely confined to physical products and local services. The digital revolution, however, has spawned whole new industries. **E-commerce** transformed retail from brick-and-mortar to global online marketplaces. **Digital marketing and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** emerged as critical business functions, unlike anything in the pre-internet era. The **"gig economy"** and **platform-based business models** (e.g., Uber, Airbnb, Upwork) are direct creations of smartphone and app technology, facilitating peer-to-peer services.

Furthermore, technology has enabled the **monetization of data itself**, making data analysis and brokerage a core business activity. The rise of **cloud computing** has created the "as-a-Service" (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) industry, where businesses sell software and infrastructure over the internet.
