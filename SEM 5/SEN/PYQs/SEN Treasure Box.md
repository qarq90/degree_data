### McCall's Quality Factors

McCall's Software Quality Model, introduced in 1977, is a framework that defines software quality through 11 aspects categorized into three main factors:

1. Product Operation:
	- Usability
	- Efficiency
	- Reliability
	- Correctness
	- Integrity
2. Product Revision:
	- Interoperability
	- Portability
	- Reusability
3. Product Transition:
	- Maintainability
	- Flexibility
	- Testability

### Differentiate between Formal-Technical Review and Walkthrough Reviews

| Aspect              | FTR              | Walkthrough        |
| :------------------ | :--------------- | :----------------- |
| **Formality Level** | High             | Low                |
| **Main Goal**       | Find defects     | Gain understanding |
| **Leader**          | Moderator        | Author             |
| **Preparation**     | Mandatory        | Optional           |
| **Focus**           | Product          | Presenter logic    |
| **Data Recording**  | Formal log       | Informal notes     |
| **Attendees**       | Peers/Experts    | Any stakeholders   |
| **Output**          | Defect report    | General feedback   |
| **Follow-up**       | Strict & tracked | Informal           |
| **Structure**       | Rigid            | Flexible           |

### Limitations of the Waterfall Model

A sequential, non-iterative development model where progress flows downwards.

**1. Inflexible to Changes:**
   Requirement changes are very difficult to incorporate.
   It is not suitable for modern dynamic projects.

**2. Late Prototype for Feedback:**
   Working software is late in the life cycle.
   Client feedback cannot be incorporated early.

**3. High Risk and Uncertainty:**
   Risks are discovered only late in the process.
   Major flaws can lead to massive rework costs.

**4. Unsuitable for Complex Projects:**
   It handles uncertainty and complexity poorly.
   All requirements must be clear upfront.

**5. Delayed Testing Phase:**
   Testing only occurs after implementation is complete.
   This can lead to the accumulation of defects.

---
### Limitations of the Spiral Model

A risk-driven process model that cycles through phases iteratively.

**1. Complex and Costly to Implement:**
   It requires significant risk-assessment expertise.
   This makes the model relatively expensive.

**2. Not Suitable for Small Projects:**
   The overhead is too great for simple systems.
   Its complexity is unjustified for low-risk projects.

**3. Heavy Dependency on Risk Analysis:**
   Success heavily relies on risk analysis expertise.
   Inexperienced teams can fail to identify risks.

**4. Can be Time-Consuming:**
   The numerous iterations can extend the timeline.
   Management may find the process too long.

**5. Difficult to Monitor and Manage:**
   The number of phases can become large.
   Progress is not as linear or clear.

### V-Model

A development model where testing is planned parallel to each development phase.

**1. Emphasizes Testing from the Start:**
   Testing activities are planned early on.
   This ensures quality is built in.

**2. Simple and Disciplined Approach:**
   It is easy to understand and use.
   Each phase has specific deliverables.

**3. Reduces Downstream Defects:**
   Early test planning catches defects early.
   This prevents fault propagation later.

**4. Suitable for Small Projects1
   It works well with clear, fixed requirements.
   It is ideal for short-duration projects.

**5. Rigid and Inflexible Structure:**
   It is difficult to accommodate changes.
   Software is delivered only at the end.

---
### Incremental Process Model

A method where software is built and delivered in small, functional increments.

**1. Generates Working Software Quickly:**
   The first increment delivers core functionality.
   Users get value early in the process.

**2. Easier to Manage and Control:**
   Breaking down the project simplifies management.
   Each increment has a small, focused scope.

**3. More Flexible to Changes:**
   Requirements can be deferred to later increments.
   It accommodates customer feedback effectively.

**4. Lowers Initial Delivery Cost:**
   Initial core features require less investment.
   Funding can be secured incrementally.

**5. Requires a Modular Design:**
   The system must be well partitioned.
   This ensures clean interfaces between increments.

---
### Evolutionary Process Model

An iterative model designed to develop software through evolving prototypes.

**1. Handles Uncertain or Changing Requirements:**
   It is ideal for poorly understood requirements.
   The system evolves with user feedback.

**2. Provides Early Visibility and Feedback:**
   Users interact with prototypes very early.
   Their feedback guides subsequent development.

**3. Manages Risks Effectively:**
   Technical and requirement risks are addressed early.
   This leads to a more robust final product.

**4. Can Lead to Scope Creep:**
   Continuous change requests can extend timelines.
   The project might lack a clear end.

**5. Requires Active Customer Involvement:**
   Constant customer collaboration is absolutely essential.
   This can be demanding for the client.

### Spiral Model

A risk-driven, iterative model that cycles through planning, risk analysis, and evaluation.

**1. Focuses on Risk Management and Reduction:**
   It identifies and mitigates risks early.
   Each cycle includes a risk analysis phase.

**2. Suitable for Large, Complex, and Critical Projects:**
   It is ideal for high-risk, expensive systems.
   It handles complexity through iterative refinement.

**3. Allows for Flexibility and Changes:**
   Requirements can be refined over multiple cycles.
   It accommodates significant changes effectively.

**4. Can be Costly and Time-Consuming:**
   The process involves significant documentation.
   Multiple iterations increase the overall cost.

**5. Requires Risk Assessment Expertise:**
   Success depends on strong risk analysis skills.
   It is not suitable for novice teams.
