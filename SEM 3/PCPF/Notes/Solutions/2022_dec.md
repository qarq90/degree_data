# Lifecycle of a Thread

The lifecycle of a thread includes the following key states:

- New: When a thread is created using a thread object, it enters the "New" state. It remains in this state until the start() method is called, which prepares it for execution. At this stage, the thread has not started running yet.
- Runnable: After calling the start() method, the thread transitions to the "Runnable" state. In this state, it is ready to run and is waiting for the CPU to allocate time for its execution. It may remain in this state until the CPU scheduler selects it.
- Running: Once the CPU assigns processing time to the thread, it enters the "Running" state and starts executing its task. This is the active execution phase of the thread.
- Blocked/Waiting: If the thread is waiting for a resource (e.g., input/output) or another thread to complete its task, it moves to the "Blocked" or "Waiting" state. This is a temporary pause in its execution. It will remain in this state until the resource becomes available or the condition is met.
- Terminated: After completing its task, the thread moves to the "Terminated" state. In this state, the thread has finished its execution and cannot be restarted. Any further attempts to start it will result in an error.

These states are managed by the operating system or runtime environment, ensuring proper scheduling, resource allocation, and synchronization.

# Types of Inheritance in OOP

Inheritance is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the derived or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called the base or parent class). The primary types of inheritance are:

1. Single Inheritance:

   - In single inheritance, a child class inherits from only one parent class. This is the simplest form of inheritance and is often used to extend or customize the functionality of a single class.
   - Example: A Car class inherits properties such as speed and capacity from a Vehicle class.

2. Multiple Inheritance:

   - In multiple inheritance, a child class inherits from two or more parent classes. This enables the child class to combine features of multiple classes.
   - Example: A FlyingCar class inherits features from both Car and Airplane classes, such as driving and flying capabilities.
     Note: Languages like Java avoid direct multiple inheritance due to potential conflicts, such as the "diamond problem."

3. Multilevel Inheritance:

   - Multilevel inheritance involves a chain of inheritance where a class inherits from another derived class. This allows for a hierarchy of inheritance.
   - Example: A SportsCar class inherits from a Car class, which itself inherits from a Vehicle class. This enables properties and methods to be passed down multiple levels.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance:

   - In hierarchical inheritance, multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class. This is used to create several specialized classes based on a general base class.
   - Example: Both Car and Bike classes inherit properties such as speed and capacity from the Vehicle class.

5. Hybrid Inheritance:
   - Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance, such as multiple and hierarchical inheritance. This often leads to complex relationships and is supported differently in various programming languages.
   - Example: A FlyingCar class inherits features from both Car and Airplane, while other specialized classes inherit from FlyingCar.

Each type of inheritance serves a specific purpose, promoting code reusability, modularity, and logical organization in software development.

# Higher-Order Functions in Haskell

Higher-order functions are at the core of functional programming and are one of the defining features of Haskell. These functions provide immense flexibility and power by allowing functions to be passed as arguments and returned as results, enabling concise and expressive code. Let’s dive into the details of what makes higher-order functions so powerful in Haskell.

## What Are Higher-Order Functions?

A higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:

1. **Takes other functions as arguments**: This allows you to abstract behavior and create generalized solutions for common programming patterns.
2. **Returns a function as a result**: This enables the creation of curried functions or dynamic behavior based on inputs.

These capabilities make higher-order functions a cornerstone of functional programming in Haskell.

## Characteristics of Higher-Order Functions

### 1. Function as an Argument

Higher-order functions can accept other functions as input parameters. For instance:

- `map` applies a given function to each element of a list.
- `filter` uses a predicate function to filter a list based on specific criteria.

### 2. Function as a Result

A higher-order function can also return a function as its output. This is frequently used in currying, where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.

### 3. Composition and Abstraction

Higher-order functions enable composition, which combines two or more functions to produce a new function. They also allow for abstraction, where you can encapsulate common patterns into reusable functions.

# Scripting Languages and Their Characteristics

## What are Scripting Languages?

Scripting languages are programming languages designed to automate tasks, manipulate data, and perform high-level operations in an application or system. Unlike traditional programming languages, scripting languages are often interpreted rather than compiled, making them highly dynamic and suitable for rapid development.

Scripting languages are primarily used for:

1. Automating repetitive tasks.
2. Enhancing or controlling the behavior of existing systems.
3. Building quick prototypes and scripts for various use cases.

### Examples of Scripting Languages:

- **JavaScript**: Used for web development and client-side scripting.
- **Python**: Used for general-purpose scripting, data analysis, and web development.
- **Bash**: Used for automating command-line tasks.
- **Ruby**: Used for web development and task automation.
- **PHP**: Used for server-side scripting in web development.

---

## Characteristics of Scripting Languages

1. **Interpreted Nature**

   - Scripting languages are typically interpreted, meaning the code is executed line-by-line without the need for compilation.
   - This allows for quick debugging and testing during development.
   - Example: Python and JavaScript run scripts directly using interpreters.

2. **Dynamic Typing**

   - Variables in scripting languages are not bound to a specific data type.
   - Data types are determined at runtime, which increases flexibility.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = 5      # Integer
     x = "text" # Now a String
     ```

3. **Platform Independence**

   - Most scripting languages are platform-independent and can run on any system with the appropriate interpreter installed.
   - Example: JavaScript runs on all modern browsers, and Python can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

4. **Automation**

   - Scripting languages are ideal for automating repetitive tasks such as file management, testing, and deployment.
   - Example: Bash scripts for automating system administration tasks.

5. **Ease of Learning and Use**

   - Scripting languages are designed to be simple and human-readable, making them accessible to beginners.
   - Example:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

6. **Integration with Other Languages**

   - Scripting languages are often embedded within other systems or applications and can work alongside compiled languages like C or Java.
   - Example: JavaScript works with HTML and CSS in web development.

7. **Rich Libraries and Frameworks**

   - They provide extensive built-in libraries and frameworks for various tasks like web development, data manipulation, and machine learning.
   - Example: Python’s `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `TensorFlow` libraries.

8. **Event-Driven Programming**

   - Many scripting languages, such as JavaScript, support event-driven programming for handling user interactions and asynchronous operations.
   - Example: JavaScript’s `addEventListener` method for DOM events.

9. **High-Level Abstraction**

   - Scripting languages abstract away complex details like memory management, allowing developers to focus on functionality.
   - Example: In Python, garbage collection is handled automatically.

10. **Cross-Domain Applicability**
    - Scripting languages are versatile and can be used across various domains like web development, data analysis, game development, and automation.
    - Example: Python for data analysis, JavaScript for web applications, and Lua for game scripting.

## Advantages of Scripting Languages

1. **Rapid Development**: Ideal for quick prototyping and iterative development.
2. **Flexibility**: Dynamic typing and easy syntax allow for faster coding.
3. **Wide Adoption**: Scripting languages like Python and JavaScript have a vast community and extensive support.

---

## Disadvantages of Scripting Languages

1. **Performance Overhead**: Interpreted execution can be slower compared to compiled languages like C++.
2. **Limited for Complex Systems**: They may not be suitable for performance-critical applications like operating systems or real-time systems.
3. **Runtime Errors**: Dynamic typing can lead to errors that are only caught during execution.

Scripting languages play a crucial role in modern programming, offering a balance between simplicity and power. Their flexibility and ease of use make them indispensable for developers in various domains.

# The Role of an Exception Handler in a Programming Language

## Introduction

An **exception handler** is a construct in programming languages that is responsible for managing runtime errors, also known as exceptions. When an error occurs during the execution of a program, an exception is raised. Without an exception handler, the program would terminate abruptly. The role of an exception handler is to catch, manage, and recover from these exceptions, ensuring that the program can either continue execution or fail gracefully.

---

## Important Tasks Performed by an Exception Handler

1. Catching Exceptions

   - The primary task of an exception handler is to catch exceptions thrown during the execution of a program.
   - When an error occurs, the program looks for an appropriate exception handler that matches the type of exception.
   - This prevents the program from crashing and allows developers to handle the error in a controlled way.

   Example:

   ```java
   try {
       int result = 10 / 0;  // This will throw ArithmeticException
   } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
       System.out.println("Error: Division by zero");
   }
   ```

2. Providing Graceful Error Handling

- Instead of letting the program crash, an exception handler ensures that the error is handled gracefully.
- This might involve displaying an error message to the user or logging the error for future analysis.
- It can also guide the program to recover and continue execution.

3. Preventing Program Crashes

- Exception handlers are used to prevent abrupt termination of the program. They allow the program to either continue execution or exit cleanly, avoiding a crash.
- Without exception handling, a program would stop when an exception occurs, causing a poor user experience and data corruption.

4. Logging and Debugging

- Exception handlers help in logging exceptions with detailed information about where the error occurred, making it easier for developers to debug the code.
- They can log the exception's stack trace, timestamp, and other relevant details to a file or console.

5. Recovery and Continuation

- In some cases, the program can be designed to recover from certain types of exceptions, allowing execution to continue.
- For example, if a network request fails, the program may retry the operation or prompt the user for input.

6. Example

```java
public class ExceptionHandlerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Simulating a divide by zero error
            int result = 10 / 0;  // This will throw ArithmeticException
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("This will always execute, regardless of exception");
        }
    }
}

```

# Storage Allocation Mechanisms: Static, Stack, and Heap Memory Allocations

Memory allocation can be broadly classified into **Static**, **Stack**, and **Heap** mechanisms based on when and how memory is allocated and managed during program execution. Here's a breakdown of the mechanisms:

---

## 1. **Static Memory Allocation**

### Description:

Static memory allocation occurs at **compile time**. The size and location of memory are determined before the program runs and remain fixed throughout execution.

### Characteristics:

- **Predefined Size**: Memory size is fixed at compile time.
- **Efficient Access**: Since memory locations are predetermined, access is fast and direct.
- **No Reallocation**: Memory cannot be resized or deallocated at runtime.
- **Minimal Overhead**: No runtime cost for allocation/deallocation.

### Example:

- **Contiguous Allocation**: Similar to static allocation as it reserves a fixed block of memory for data.
- **Global Variables**: Memory for global or static variables in a program is statically allocated.

---

## 2. **Stack Memory Allocation**

### Description:

Stack memory allocation is used for **function calls**, local variables, and execution contexts. Memory is managed in a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** manner, following the function call stack.

### Characteristics:

- **Dynamic but Temporary**: Memory is allocated when a function is called and deallocated when it returns.
- **Efficient**: LIFO structure ensures fast allocation and deallocation.
- **Limited Size**: Stack memory is limited, unsuitable for large data structures.
- **Automatic Management**: Memory is managed by the system automatically.

### Example:

- **Linked Allocation**: Similar to stack allocation, where blocks (or frames) are dynamically linked during function calls.
- **Function Calls**: Local variables and execution contexts are stored on the stack.

---

## 3. **Heap Memory Allocation**

### Description:

Heap memory allocation is used for **dynamic memory management**. Memory is allocated manually by the programmer or automatically using garbage collection. The heap is ideal for large or complex data structures that persist beyond a single function's scope.

### Characteristics:

- **Dynamic and Flexible**: Memory can be allocated and resized at runtime.
- **Fragmentation**: Internal and external fragmentation can occur over time.
- **Slower Access**: Accessing heap memory is slower than stack memory due to additional overhead.
- **Manual Management**: The programmer must explicitly allocate and deallocate memory in languages like C/C++.

### Example:

- **Indexed Allocation**: Similar to heap allocation where pointers are used to access scattered memory blocks.
- **Paged Allocation**: Dynamically allocated pages mapped to virtual addresses resemble heap allocation.
- **Memory Pool Allocation**: Pre-allocated blocks within the heap mimic manual dynamic allocation for efficiency.

---

# Differences Between Static, Stack, and Heap Memory Allocation

| Feature                | Static Allocation                             | Stack Allocation                                  | Heap Allocation                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Timing**             | Allocated at compile time.                    | Allocated at runtime (when a function is called). | Allocated at runtime, on demand.                          |
| **Flexibility**        | Fixed size and location.                      | Dynamic but limited to function scope.            | Fully dynamic and resizable.                              |
| **Lifetime**           | Exists for the entire program execution.      | Exists during the function’s execution.           | Exists until explicitly deallocated or garbage collected. |
| **Management**         | Managed by the compiler.                      | Managed automatically by the system.              | Managed manually by the programmer or garbage collector.  |
| **Speed**              | Fastest access due to fixed memory locations. | Fast access because of LIFO structure.            | Slower due to dynamic allocation and pointer referencing. |
| **Memory Size**        | Fixed and predefined at compile time.         | Limited by the stack size.                        | Limited by the total available memory.                    |
| **Fragmentation**      | No fragmentation.                             | No fragmentation.                                 | Internal and external fragmentation can occur.            |
| **Usage**              | Used for global and static variables.         | Used for local variables and function calls.      | Used for large or complex data structures.                |
| **Example Mechanisms** | Contiguous Allocation, Global Variables.      | Linked Allocation, Function Calls.                | Indexed Allocation, Paged Allocation, Memory Pools.       |
| **Overhead**           | Minimal runtime overhead.                     | Minimal runtime overhead.                         | Higher overhead due to allocation and deallocation.       |

# Logic Programming

## Introduction:

Logic programming is a programming paradigm based on formal logic. In logic programming, programs are written as a series of logical statements, and computation is performed by querying these statements. Unlike imperative programming, where you specify how to do things step-by-step, in logic programming, you define **what** the problem is, and the system determines **how** to solve it based on logical rules and facts.

Logic programming is commonly used in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. The most well-known logic programming language is **Prolog** (Programming in Logic), which is based on formal logic.

---

## Key Concepts in Logic Programming:

Logic programming consists of three key elements:

1. **Facts**
2. **Rules**
3. **Queries**

Let's discuss each of these concepts in detail:

### 1. Facts

Facts represent basic truths about the world in a logic programming language. A fact is a statement that is unconditionally true. These are the fundamental building blocks of a logic program.

#### Example of a Fact:

In a knowledge base about family relationships, you can define facts such as:

```prolog
father(john, mary).    % John is the father of Mary.
mother(susan, mary).   % Susan is the mother of Mary.
```

These facts establish relationships between entities (like "John" and "Mary"). In Prolog, a fact is a statement that doesn't need to be further explained or proved.

### 2. Rules

Rules define relationships between facts. They specify how certain facts can be derived from other facts. Rules consist of a head (the conclusion) and a body (the conditions that need to be satisfied for the conclusion to be true).

A rule is written in the form of a logical implication. It is a conditional statement: if certain conditions are met, then a certain conclusion follows.
Example of a Rule:

If someone is the father of a child and someone is the mother of the same child, then that someone is the parent of the child.

```prolog
parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).  % If X is the father of Y, then X is a parent of Y.
parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).  % If X is the mother of Y, then X is a parent of Y.
```

Here, parent(X, Y) is the head (the conclusion), and father(X, Y) or mother(X, Y) is the body (the condition for being a parent).

### 3. Queries

Queries are questions asked to the logic programming system to infer new information from the existing facts and rules. A query is used to ask the program if a particular fact is true or if certain conditions can be satisfied.

A query asks the system to search through the facts and rules to determine if a given statement can be derived.
Example of a Query:

Now, suppose you want to know whether John is a parent of Mary:

```prolog
?- parent(john, mary).
```

### 4. Complete

```prolog
% Facts
father(john, mary).    % John is the father of Mary.
mother(susan, mary).   % Susan is the mother of Mary.

% Rules
parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).  % If X is the father of Y, then X is a parent of Y.
parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).  % If X is the mother of Y, then X is a parent of Y.

% Query
?- parent(john, mary).  % Query to check if John is a parent of Mary.

```

### 5. Explanation:

- The facts state that John is Mary's father, and Susan is Mary's mother.
- The rules define that anyone who is either a father or a mother is a parent.
- The query asks whether John is a parent of Mary. The system will answer "yes" because of the facts and rules.5

# Type and Type Classes in Haskell

## Introduction

Haskell is a statically typed functional programming language, meaning every expression has a type that is checked during compilation. The concept of **Type** and **Type Classes** in Haskell is fundamental in ensuring the correctness and expressiveness of the language. Types in Haskell describe the kind of data an expression can hold, while type classes provide a way to define a set of functions that can operate on a specific group of types.

---

## 1. Types in Haskell

A **type** in Haskell defines the kind of data that can be manipulated. Every value in Haskell has a type, which is used by the compiler to check the program for type correctness. A type could be something simple like an integer, a floating-point number, or even more complex structures like lists or functions.

### Example of Types:

```haskell
-- Integer type
x :: Int
x = 10

-- Boolean type
y :: Bool
y = True

-- Function type: takes an integer and returns a boolean
isEven :: Int -> Bool
isEven n = n `mod` 2 == 0
```

- x :: Int declares that x is of type Int, which represents an integer.
- y :: Bool declares that y is of type Bool, which can either be True or False.
- isEven :: Int -> Bool declares a function isEven that takes an Int as input and returns a Bool. The function checks if the integer is even.

In the above example, we see that values in Haskell are always associated with specific types like Int (for integers) and Bool (for boolean values).

Types in Haskell can also be polymorphic (i.e., able to work with any type). This is where the type variables come into play.

### Polymorphic:

```haskell
-- A polymorphic function that works with any type
identity :: a -> a
identity x = x

```

- identity :: a -> a is a polymorphic function that takes a value of any type a and returns a value of the same type a. The type variable a represents any type.

The identity function demonstrates how polymorphism in Haskell works. The function doesn't care about the type of data it receives; it simply returns the same data back.

## 2. Type Classes

A type class in Haskell is a collection of types that support a specific set of operations. Type classes define a set of functions that can be implemented for different types. They provide a way to create generic functions that can operate on different types.

Type classes allow for ad-hoc polymorphism, meaning that different types can have specific implementations of the same function.

```haskell
-- Define a type class for "showing" values
class Show a where
  show :: a -> String

-- Define instances of the Show class for Int and Bool
instance Show Int where
  show x = "Int: " ++ Prelude.show x

instance Show Bool where
  show True  = "True"
  show False = "False"

```

- 'class' Show a where defines a type class Show, which requires the implementation of the function show that takes a value of type a and returns a String.
- The instance Show Int and instance Show Bool lines define how to show values of type Int and Bool.

Explanation:

- The Show type class enables us to display values as strings.
- We have defined specific behavior for Int and Bool types by providing instance declarations for these types.
- For Int, the show function prefixes the output with "Int: ".
- For Bool, it shows "True" or "False" based on the boolean value.

3. The Role of Type Classes

Type classes serve several important purposes:

- Polymorphism: Type classes allow you to define functions that can work with multiple types, without having to define different versions of the same function for each type.
- Code Reusability: By abstracting operations into type classes, you can create highly reusable and general code that works across multiple types.
- Type Safety: Type classes help ensure that operations on values are type-safe by making sure the required functions are implemented for each type.
- Types define the kind of data a program can manipulate.
- Type classes define a set of operations that can be performed on types.
- Haskell's type system allows for polymorphism and code reusability.
- Type classes ensure type safety and enable ad-hoc polymorphism.

# Communication and Synchronization Techniques in Concurrent Programming Model

In concurrent programming, multiple processes or threads are executed simultaneously, which can result in issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and inconsistent data. To manage these issues, communication and synchronization techniques are essential. Below are the main techniques used in concurrent programming:

## 1. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

**Definition**: IPC refers to the techniques used for exchanging data between processes or threads in a system.

**Techniques**:

- **Shared Memory**: Multiple processes can access the same region of memory, and thus communicate by reading and writing data to this shared memory area. However, synchronization is needed to prevent data corruption.
- **Message Passing**: Processes communicate by sending and receiving messages. This can be done through message queues or sockets, which allows for communication between processes that do not share memory. Message passing ensures that processes do not directly alter each other’s state, reducing the risk of data corruption.
- **Pipes and Named Pipes**: Pipes allow one-way communication between processes. Data written to the pipe by one process can be read by another. Named pipes (also known as FIFOs) allow named communication paths between processes.
- **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**: This technique enables one program to cause a procedure to be executed in another address space (commonly on a different machine), which can be used for communication between distributed systems.

## 2. Synchronization Mechanisms

Synchronization ensures that multiple processes or threads work together without interfering with each other in an undesired way. Below are some of the main synchronization techniques:

- **Locks**:

  - **Mutex** (Mutual Exclusion): A mutex ensures that only one thread or process can access a resource at a time. Other threads/processes attempting to access the locked resource must wait until the mutex is released.
  - **Spinlocks**: A type of lock where the thread continuously checks if the lock is available. This is less efficient than a mutex because it wastes CPU cycles but may be suitable in certain low-latency environments.

- **Semaphores**:

  - **Definition**: A semaphore is a variable used to control access to a common resource in a concurrent system. Semaphores maintain a count that can be incremented or decremented to indicate the number of resources available.
  - **Binary Semaphore**: A special case of a semaphore that can only have two values: 0 or 1, similar to a mutex.
  - **Counting Semaphore**: Used to control access to a resource pool that contains multiple instances of the same resource.

- **Monitors**:

  - **Definition**: A monitor is an abstraction that encapsulates shared resources and the operations that can be performed on them. It includes condition variables and ensures that only one process or thread can execute the code inside the monitor at a time.
  - **Condition Variables**: Used within monitors to allow threads to wait until a particular condition is met before proceeding.

- **Barrier Synchronization**:

  - **Definition**: A barrier is a type of synchronization where a set of threads or processes must all reach a certain point in their execution before any can proceed. This is useful in situations where a group of tasks must be synchronized at certain checkpoints.
  - **Use Case**: Often used in parallel computing tasks to ensure all threads complete one phase before moving to the next.

- **Read/Write Locks**:

  - **Definition**: A read/write lock allows multiple threads to read from a shared resource concurrently but ensures that only one thread can write to the resource at a time. This helps optimize access to resources where reading is more frequent than writing.

- **Critical Section**:
  - **Definition**: A critical section is a part of the code where shared resources are accessed and must be executed by only one process or thread at a time. Critical sections are typically protected using locks or other synchronization mechanisms.

## 3. Deadlock Prevention and Avoidance

- **Deadlock**: A situation where two or more threads/processes are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources.
- **Techniques to Avoid Deadlocks**:
  - **Deadlock Prevention**: This involves structuring the system in a way that it is impossible for deadlock to occur, such as by acquiring all resources at once or using a total ordering of resource acquisition.
  - **Deadlock Detection and Recovery**: This technique involves allowing deadlock to occur but detecting it when it happens and recovering by aborting or rolling back the process involved.

## 4. Atomic Operations

- **Definition**: Atomic operations are operations that are performed as a single, indivisible step, without the possibility of interference from other processes or threads. These are often used in situations where you need to modify shared data in a way that avoids race conditions.
- **Example**: Incrementing a counter without the risk of one thread interrupting another thread’s update.

## 5. Event Synchronization

- **Definition**: Event synchronization is used to coordinate threads or processes based on specific events or signals. Threads can wait for a certain event to happen before proceeding.
- **Example**: A thread might wait for a signal that a particular file is ready to be processed before it begins its task.

### Define a Haskell function named "addUs" that adds 2 input numbers. Using this function as a building block, define a Haskell function "multiplyUs" that multiplies two input numbers. The multiplyUs function should cater to following:

- i. Inputs may be signed numbers e.g. "multiplyUs (-2) _ (3)" should result in "-6" and
  "multiplyUs (-2) _ (-6)" should result in "12"
- ii. It should use guard expressions and recursion.
- iii. No need to write the main function to do user interaction. Writing definition for
  "addUs" and "multiplyUs" is sufficient. Explain type signature for your code.

```haskell
-- Defining the 'addUs' function that adds two numbers
addUs :: Int -> Int -> Int
addUs x y = x + y

-- Defining the 'multiplyUs' function that multiplies two numbers using recursion and guard expressions
multiplyUs :: Int -> Int -> Int
multiplyUs x y
  | y == 0    = 0                              -- Base case: If second number is 0, the result is 0
  | y < 0     = -(multiplyUs x (negate y))     -- If second number is negative, negate the result
  | otherwise = addUs x (multiplyUs x (y - 1)) -- Recursive case: Add the first number repeatedly

-- Main function to test the addUs and multiplyUs functions
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let resultAdd = addUs 2 3  -- Example of addition
  putStrLn ("Result of addition: " ++ show resultAdd)

  let resultMultiply = multiplyUs (-2) 3  -- Example of multiplication with negative numbers
  putStrLn ("Result of multiplication: " ++ show resultMultiply)
```

# Types of Bindings in Programming Languages

Bindings refer to the association between a variable and its value or type in a program. There are several types of bindings:

- Static Binding: The association between a variable and its value or type is determined at compile-time. This is the case in statically typed languages like Java and C++.

- Dynamic Binding: The association between a variable and its value or type is determined at runtime. Languages like Python and JavaScript support dynamic binding.

- Lexical Binding: The binding occurs based on the structure of the program code, such as the location of variable declarations in the code.

- Name Binding: The variable's name is bound to a value or location in memory.

# Need for Thread Synchronization in Concurrent Programming

Thread synchronization is essential in concurrent programming to ensure that multiple threads can operate safely and efficiently when sharing resources. Without proper synchronization, race conditions, data inconsistency, and deadlocks can occur.

Key reasons for synchronization:

- Race Conditions: When multiple threads try to modify shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results.
- Data Integrity: Ensures that shared data is accessed by one thread at a time, preventing corruption.
- Deadlock Prevention: Proper synchronization can prevent threads from blocking each other indefinitely, ensuring that all threads eventually complete their work.

Methods of synchronization:

- Mutexes: Used to lock a resource, ensuring that only one thread can access it at a time.
- Semaphores: Used to control access to a resource by multiple threads.
- Monitors: High-level abstractions that combine locks and condition variables to manage access.
